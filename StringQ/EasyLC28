/**

We will be using recurion here and will pass "1" to it
In recursion.. we will start a while loop with a pointer and count..
we will loop throug the loop and until we find repeated character, we will increase counter by 1 
Once the repeated characters are exhaused we will add the character at pointer and counter to a stringbuilder and pass it on again to the recursive function

this recursive function will go on until your global counter reaches n
